# 🌐 APIs for Mobile & Front-End - Study Tracker

This folder contains my study notes, API request collections (Postman), and theoretical summaries from the **"APIs for Mobile / Front-End"** course by Eng. Omar Ahmed.

The goal of this section is to build a rock-solid understanding of how Front-End/Mobile applications communicate with Back-End servers using HTTP requests.
