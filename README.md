# 🚀 Tech Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Tech Learning Journey** repository! 👋 I'm **Amr F. Elsherif (Sherif)**.

This repository serves as a centralized, structured vault for my continuous learning in software engineering and mobile development. Rather than scattering small tutorial projects across my GitHub profile, I use this monorepo to document code snippets, practice structured architecture, and store project implementations from various technical short courses and tutorials.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- **Centralized Reference:** A quick go-to place for state management setups, API handling, and architectural patterns.
- **Skill Tracking:** Keeping a clear log of the specific concepts I'm mastering to transition into professional Mobile Development.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Ensuring every theoretical concept learned is backed by functional code.
