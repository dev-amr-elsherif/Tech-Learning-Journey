# 🚀 Tech Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Tech Learning Journey** repository! 👋 I'm **Amr Fathy Elsherif (Sherif)**.

This repository serves as a centralized, structured vault for my continuous learning in software engineering and mobile development. Rather than scattering small tutorial projects across my GitHub profile, I use this monorepo to document code snippets, practice clean architecture, and store complete project implementations from the various technical courses I undertake.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- **Centralized Reference:** A quick go-to place for architectural patterns (MVC, Clean Architecture), state management setups, and API integration examples.
- **Skill Tracking:** Keeping a clear, chronological log of the courses I've completed and the core concepts I'm mastering to transition from Web Development to Mobile Development.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Ensuring every theoretical concept learned is backed by functional, well-structured code.
